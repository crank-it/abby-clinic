    },
    {
      q: "How long does setup take?",
      a: "About 5 minutes to connect your account. However, full functionality requires 1-2 working days as Abby only processes SMS sent after activation."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I generate the Cliniko API key?",
      a: "In Cliniko, click 'My Info' (bottom left) → 'Manage API Keys' → 'Add an API Key' → name it 'Abby' → click 'Create' → copy the key immediately (it's only shown once)."
    },
    {
      q: "Why isn't Abby working right after setup?",
      a: "Abby only interprets SMS replies sent after account creation. Depending on your reminder schedule (24-72 hours before appointments), allow 1-2 working days before expecting results."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the Clinic Pin?",
      a: "A single PIN set during onboarding that authenticates the Chrome extension. All staff in your clinic share this PIN—no individual logins needed."
    },
    {
      q: "How long until Abby starts working after setup?",
      a: "Allow 1-2 business days. Abby needs to sync with your Cliniko account and can only interpret SMS sent after activation. Depending on when your appointment reminders go out (typically 24-72 hours before appointments), you'll see colours appear within 1-2 business days."
    },
    {
      q: "Do all my staff need separate Abby accounts?",
      a: "No. Only one API key is needed per clinic. The Clinic Pin system allows your entire team to access Abby without separate logins or API keys—everyone shares the same Clinic Pin."
    }
  ],
  extension: [
    {
      q: "Why do the colours disappear when I click an appointment?",
      a: "Cliniko refreshes the page when you click an appointment, which clears Abby's colour overlay. Simply click the Abby icon in your toolbar again to reapply the colours—takes one second."
    },
    {
      q: "Why is there a 15-minute delay before SMS responses appear?",
      a: "Abby polls Cliniko's API every 15 minutes (Cliniko doesn't support real-time webhooks). New SMS replies won't appear until the next polling cycle."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I manage multiple Cliniko accounts?",
      a: "Create separate Chrome browser profiles for each clinic. Install the Abby extension in each profile with the respective Clinic Pin. You cannot manage multiple clinics in a single Chrome instance."
    },
    {
      q: "Does Abby work on Safari, Firefox, or Edge?",
      a: "No—Chrome desktop browser only. The extension architecture requires Chrome's APIs."
    },
    {
      q: "Does Abby work on mobile devices or tablets?",
      a: "No—it's a desktop Chrome application only. However, you do still see the SMS replies in your appointment notes, which can be incredibly helpful for some people."
    },
    {
      q: "Why does the Chrome extension need those permissions?",
      a: "The extension needs 'tabs' permission to read your Cliniko calendar, 'scripting' permission to apply colour overlays, and 'storage' permission to remember your Clinic Pin. Abby cannot access other websites or your browsing history—only the Cliniko calendar page when you're logged in."
    }
  ],
  ai: [
    {
      q: "What AI does Abby use?",
      a: "A proprietary language model developed specifically for healthcare appointment confirmations—not OpenAI, ChatGPT, Google, or any third-party AI. Your SMS data never leaves Abby's systems."
    },
    {
      q: "What does 98% accuracy mean?",
      a: "Approximately 98 out of 100 SMS replies are correctly categorized as confirmed, cancelled, or reschedule. The remaining ~2% with unclear intent are flagged RED for manual review."
    },
    {
      q: "How does Abby handle confusing messages?",
      a: "Conflicting intents (like 'Yep sorry I can't come') trigger a RED flag with 'Call to discuss' note—Abby doesn't guess when intent is ambiguous."
    },
    {
      q: "Can Abby understand emojis?",
      a: "Yes, most common emojis work. Our AI is continuously trained on real-world responses including emoji-only replies like 👍."
    },
    {
      q: "Does capitalisation matter in SMS replies?",
      a: "No. Abby interprets 'Y', 'y', 'YES', 'yes', 'yep', 'YEP' and all natural variations equally. Case doesn't matter."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need to change my SMS reminder template?",

    }
  ],
  limitations: [
    {
      q: "Does Abby send SMS to patients?",
      a: "No—Abby is read-only. It only interprets replies to SMS that Cliniko sends. You must have Cliniko SMS reminders configured."
    },
    {
      q: "Why didn't Abby capture my manual SMS conversation?",
      a: "Abby only processes replies to Cliniko's automated appointment reminder SMS. Manual messages sent through Cliniko's messaging feature lack the appointment identifier in Cliniko's API, so Abby can't link them to appointments. This is a Cliniko API limitation."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I use Abby with practice management software other than Cliniko?",
      a: "No—Abby integrates exclusively with Cliniko. We may support other systems in the future."

      q: "What's the maximum number of practitioners?",
      a: "One Abby account supports up to 24 practitioners. Contact us if you need more."

      a: "Only the appointment notes field. Abby cannot change appointment status, modify patient records, or alter any other data."
    },
    {
      q: "I use Cliniko but send SMS through another platform. Will Abby work?",
      a: "No. Abby requires Cliniko's built-in automated appointment reminder SMS. Third-party SMS platforms (like MessageMedia, SMS Broadcast, etc.) don't include the appointment identifier that Abby needs to link replies to appointments in Cliniko's API."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I use Abby on my iPad or phone?",
      a: "The Chrome extension only works on desktop Chrome browsers. However, Abby posts all interpreted responses to your appointment notes in Cliniko, which you can view on any device—iPad, iPhone, Android. Desktop users see colours, mobile users see notes. Same information, different display."
    },
    {
      q: "Is Abby available in the United States?",

    },
    {
      q: "What happens when a patient sends a confusing or contradictory reply?",
